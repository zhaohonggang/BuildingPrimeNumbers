Use Complete Factor Number building Prime. Found Rule of Primes!

The definition of Complete Factor Number: it is the product of continue primes from the lowest prime.I also call it as Complete Composite numbers, since they look like profect Composite numbers.

Complete Factor Number List: 1, 2, 6, 30, 210, 2310, 30030......(as 1x1=1, 1x2=2,1x2x3=6, 1x2x3x5=30,1x2x3x5x7=210...)

Examples of building Prime, from 1:

Complete Factor Number 1
Prime 2=1+1


Complete Factor Number 2=1x2
3=2+1
5=2x2+1


Complete Factor Number 6=2x3, 5 is not 6’s factor and 5 < 6，5 x 5 is between 6 and 30

7=6+1
11=6+5
13=2x6+1
17=2x6+5
19=3x6+1
23=3x6+5
25=4x6+1=5x5 Remove
29=4x6+5


Complete Factor Number 30=2x3x5，Prime 7 to 29 is not 30’s factor and less than 30
31=30+1
37=30+7
41=30+11
43=30+13
...
53=30+23
59=30+29

61=30x2+1
67=30x2+7
...
77=30x2+17=7x11 remove
...
89=30x2+29

...

181=30x6+1
...
191=30x6+11
...
209=30x6+29=11x19


Complete Factor Number 210=2x3x5x7, 
List 11，13...31..77（Composite)..209（Composite) has no sharing factor with 210 and less than 210
211=210+1
...
2101=210x10+1=191x11 
...
2309=210x10+209




Description:

m is Complete Factor Number. m=1 x.....x p
n is the next Complete Factor Number after m. n=m x q = 1 x...x p x q
[q..m] is the set of all primes and products of primes between q and m. The members of [q..m] is unlimited. If a, b, c are in this set, a x a x a..., bxb...., axaxb, axbxcxc…will also in this set


theorem 1: This theorem describes all prime numbers between m and n can be built using this approach
If b is prime, m < b < n, b can be describe as b = k x m + a
1 <=k < q, a < m, a is 1 or belong to [q..m]

theorem 2: This theorem describe using this approach can build all exact prime numbers between m and n, no more or less
For all b that m<b<n and b = k x m + a (1 <=k < q, a < m, a is 1 or belong to [q..m])
If b is not a prime number and c is a prime factor of b, then q <=c < m (It is equal as b belong to [q..m] and m < b <n)

The Prove of theorem 1:
 if a is belong to [q..m], if a is Prime then a is a factor of m. if a is not a Prime then one of a’s factor is a factor of m, then b is not a prime number. It is conflict with “b is prime”.

The Prove of theorem 2: 
k x m and a don’t have a common factor. If  k x m + a is not prime and if c is one of prime factor of b and if c < q, then c is a factor of m, then c is a factor of a. It is conflict with  “a is 1 or belong to [q..m]”

The way of building Primes between m and n:

First, find a set of [q..m] between q and m. as a
Then, fine a set of [q..m] between m and n, as a set c to be removed from b
Then, use b = k x m + a to build all of b
Then remove c from b
You will get a set of primes between [m…n]

Now describ how to based on Complete Factor Number(m) to describe the law of Prime Numbers Distribution.

We can prove, if a belong to [q..m], a < m then m - a is also belong to [q..m]

So (a, m-a) is a pair on the side of m/2. Therefore, the numbers, which in [q..m] which are bigger than 0 and smaller than m, are appear by pairs. Those pairs include (1,m-1) and other pairs are inside the area of q <= (x,y) <= m - q, I call it [q..m-q]. So I call the full set between 0 and m as {1,[q..m-q],m-1}. 

Therefore, {1,[q..m-q],m-1} is the sub set of [q..m] between 0 and m. This set include all prime numbers who are smaller than m exclude m's prime factors. This set may also include some Composite numbers which not sharing prime factors with m. This set is the feeds of building the prime numbers between m to n.
